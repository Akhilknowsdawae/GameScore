**The Product Goal:**
Our product aims to become the go-to platform for gamers, increasing user engagement, and aligning with the broader business goal of gaining more users by the investor check-in in April.
This increase will be measured through user registrations, review submissions, and overall platform interaction. User feedback and continuous improvements to the platform will contribute to achieving this goal. 
This goal directly matters to users by enhancing their gaming experience through reliable information and community engagement. It is also relevant to stakeholders as increased user engagement aligns with the organizational objective of attracting investors. 
The product is set for the investor check-in date in April. However, flexibility is acknowledged to allow adjustments based on insights gained during the period, ensuring the goal remains realistic and achievable.
